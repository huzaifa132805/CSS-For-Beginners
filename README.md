# CSS-For-Beginners
We will create a CSS file separately and later connect it with HTML. 
This is the best practice to be followed because it meets industry standards.
In this repo, you will also find a link to Google Fonts for which you need to have an internet connection.
Every CSS file is connected with the same style sheet name. i.e. capstone.css is connected with capstone.html
